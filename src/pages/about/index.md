### Dr. Perriann Beyers, LCSW/MFT
A social worker who holds a master's or doctoral degree in social work from an accredited school of social work in addition to at least two years of post-master's supervised experience in a clinical setting. The social worker must be licensed, certified, or registered at the clinical level in the jurisdiction of practice. A clinical social worker provides direct services, including interventions focused on interpersonal interactions, intrapsychic dynamics, and life management issues. Clinical social work services are based on bio-psychosocial perspectives. Services consist of assessment, diagnosis, treatment (including psychotherapy and counseling), client-centered advocacy, consultation, evaluation, and prevention of mental illness, emotional, or behavioral disturbances.


### Steve Beyers, LCSW/MFT
I am Steve Beyers, a Commercial Banker and Psychotherapist! I have served as a banker in Utah for over 15 years, and have 40 years of banking experience in virtually every aspect of banking, including 20 years in commercial banking, as well as experience in private banking, residential mortgage, and retail bank management.

In addition, I also have a Master's Degree in Mental Health Counseling, serving as a Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselor, and specializing with those struggling with addictions and substance abuse.

I believe that education is one of the key components in achieving success, and I have been fortunate to earn degrees from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (Business Management & Economics), University of Oklahoma (Graduate of Commercial Lending), the University of Colorado at Boulder (Graduate School of Banking), and the University of Phoenix (Master's in Mental Health Counseling).

In addition, I believe that we get back from what we put forth. In order to make a contribution, I currently serve on the Board of Directors at the 4th Street Clinic and the Utah Nonprofits Association, and have the opportunity to serve our community through these agencies.

Finally, I believe in having fun! Life is meant to embrace and enjoy. So I try to bring a smile to someone's face in a number of ways, including the following:

####Presentations to groups of 25 - 300 on topics such as:
- Motivational/Encouragement
- Spiritual Parallels to Temporal Experiences
- Managing & Overcoming Fears
- Looking for Possibilities
- Dangers & Managing Addictions
- Even a little Stand Up Comedy!

Both in business management and mental wellness, with my many years of work experience, education, and community service, I can provide the right type of training, coaching, team building and financing that businesses and organizations like yours deserve...to successfully reach your goals.

I welcome the opportunity to meet with you and assist you in your success!
